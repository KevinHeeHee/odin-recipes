  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>One of Gordon Ramsey's signature dishes, a beef wellington consists of a cut of beef that is
    coated in pate, wrapped in puff pastry, and baked until the pasty is a golden brown.
  </p>
  <p>The dish is perfect for multiple occasions, from holidays to anniversaries. In total, this dish
    should take around an hour and 10 minutes to finish.
